# Graphics-Skinning
David Yuan, Sophia Li

Bone Picking:
  Moving the cursor over a bone will highlight it, as well as selecting it for any potential bone manipulation actions.
  Release the mouse button will reset the highlight/selections, so you must move the mouse again to use this feature.

Bone Rotation:
  Controls are as specified in the assignment page.
  Rotations are done so points on the bone should look the same distance from the screen as they were before rotation.
  Rolling the bone uses a rotation axis pointing from bone's starting position to it's endpoing.

Skinning:
  As specified in the assignment page.

Extra credit:  but also translation of the root joints.
